Congratulations!  If you are reading this document, you have 
proven that you are able to clone a repository from GitHub Classroom!

From now on, we will be using GHC for PEXs (NOT FOR LABS).  You will use the platform
to grab the PEX template files, and you will use the add, commit, and push
commands to periodically upload your code!

Instructions for Committing and Pushing your code to GitHub Classroom:

1.  Open a command prompt, and navigate to the folder containing this files

2.  Type:  git add *
    Explanation:  This command tells git what files you want to add/remove from your repository.  The * basically means "add everything"

3.  Type:  git commit -m "A message goes here.  Please do write this message literally--come up with something original.  Are you still writing this?  Stop!"
    Explanation:  This command creates a checkpoint for your code.

4.  Type:  git push
    Explanation:  This command uploads your code to GitHub Classroom to be archived.  

You can repeat these steps multiple times.  Get into the habit of saving your code frequently, as you don't want to lose anything!
